USOS API Browser
================

**USOS API Browser** is a simple interactive OAuth client for Windows, designed
for browsing and testing [USOS API](https://apps.usos.edu.pl/developers/api/)
methods.

USOS API server. The screenshot may be outdated.

Disclaimer
----------

This application is for testing purposes only. It was written as a quick
example of basic USOS API usage. There are tons of `WebExceptions` it doesn't
even try to catch!

Having that said, I still think that it is quite useful developer tool,
especially if you're aiming for a deep understanding on how the [USOS API
OAuth authorization](http://apps.usos.edu.pl/developers/api/authorization/)
actually works.
