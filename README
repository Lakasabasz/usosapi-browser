This application is for testing purposes only. The are tons of WebExceptions
it doesn't even try to catch. Please note that I am not an experienced .NET
programmer and it is actually the first application on WPF platform I ever
made.

Having that said, I still think that it is still quite useful developer tool,
especially if you're aiming for a deep understanding on how the USOS API
OAuth authentication actually works.
